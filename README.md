## In The Groove


One of my favorite hobbies is playing In The Groove (ITG) which is a somewhat obscure arcade dance game from the early 2000s. I play a variant of ITG which is focused on stamina and speed as one of my workout routines.

I stream live on my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/dom_itg) and you can find previous highlights on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpeNRVOVrqx_lras7hbOOrQ) and I track my achievements on the [Groovestats leaderboard](http://groovestats.com/?page=profile&id=66762).
